## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to run any of the projects on your local machine.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Navigate to a project folder:**
    Each project is in its own directory.
    ```bash
    # Example: Navigate to the To-Do List API project
    cd "2. To-Do List REST API (No DB)"
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
